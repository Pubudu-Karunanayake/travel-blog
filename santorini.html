                The little island of Santorini in Greece is famous for its photogenic old blue-and-white <br>
                buildings, beautiful high end hotels with infinity pools, and sweeping views of the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
                Santorini is almost synonymous with luxury nowadays, but it’s also possible to travel the <br>
                 island on a budget, and many of the best things to do in Santorini are free, such as 
                 strolling <br>  the historic towns, taking pictures, relaxing on the beach, and seeing the
                 sunset.
            </p>
            <p>
                A trip to the Greek islands wouldn’t be complete without seeing Santorini for at least a few <br>
                days, and it’s easier than ever to get there from Athens and other major cities in Europe.
